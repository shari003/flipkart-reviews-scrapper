"Trust me !! It‚Äôs been couple of months since I was trying to buy something in this particular budget and after lots of research I found this one and it‚Äôs amazing, cooling,looks,specially remote which is new and you can operate from anywhere, In the sense you No need to stand in front of the AC the sensor works really good, apart from this, installation people were really good and they were very well trained and professional as well, totally satisfied with this product, God for it üíïüëçüèªREAD MORE",5
"Really, it is awesome! You must buy it. It is better than my expectation. It is better from all ways like it is an inverter air conditioner, it has a 5-star rating by BEE, the used gas is 'R32' which is the best air conditioner gas. Also, it is a 1.6-ton air conditioner which is the best comfortable tonnage rating for my room.READ MORE",5
"Voltas ac is the best for me. The quality of TATA and trust factor means a lot. They have the good features and design with energy efficiency for all groups. I will suggest any can buy this with the good faith. The given cupper pipe and wires are 10ft only, Voltas must give 15ft at least. Overall a better experience üôèREAD MORE",5

Thankyou Flipkart. Received 100%damage free product. We went to a showroom to buy voltas ac. But the sales person washed our mind and suggest to buy another brand. We are using voltas from past 8 years. So that we trusted the brand. RECEIVED EXACT PRODUCT OF RECENT MANUFACTURING... QUICK INSTALLATION ARRANGED BY FLIPKART.price also very fair. We can change the tonnage in this model. Thank you voltas. My suggestion is Flipkart is best Desi app. Just go for this model.READ MORE,5
"I bought this one 15 days ago for 32850 rs with VG 400 stabilizer after analysing all offers .many reviews here are having suspicion about the quality of the product , installation charges and delay . but the delivered product seems to be genuine with good packing after getting the stabilizer i informed local voltas people they installed it next day itself .they ask me 1700 rs as charges but after knowing the FILIPKART agreement they charged only 1200 rs only , they are very co-operative and ...READ MORE",4

"Very bad installation experience by voltas. How ever the installation guy came within 1 hr of delivery. Installation person was in so mich hurry, not willing to listen to any reasonable instruction.

"Nice product in reasonable price. Voltas was my 1st preference as it is the only indigenous product & number one Brand of India. All other features are good except the front design of inner unit. Brown outer lining on the flap is not good nor desirable. Had it been sleek white, the looks would have been better. The curvy look also not good. Cooling is nice but chilling effect is not there as in normal Airconditioner. Inverter AC consumes less power and soothing. Otherwise its value for money....READ MORE",4

At the time of sale flipkart intentionally did not inform the customer that they will not provide copper pipes for installation. The installation engineer then charge huge amount for copper pipes which could have been avoided if flipkart would have provided the copper pipes. Buy from CROMA they provide copper pipes also with ac in same price with free installation. Flipkart is making customers fool and is the worst site.ü§¨üò°ü§¨ü•µü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°READ MORE,1
