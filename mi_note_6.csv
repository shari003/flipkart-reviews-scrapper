"Nice Phone but bit pricey as compared to other devices. Xiaomi released the device in a hurry without giving much thought. The phone is good in camera department but when it comes to performance, the 2 years old SD 636 is outperformed by phones in similar price range out there like RealMe 2 Pro with SD 660. Games like PUBG will play nicely on this phone but Graphics wont be great and will be laggy sometimes, also the bulky notch will interfere everytime.

"'Value for money' handset, no doubt. But the previous verson, 'note 5 pro' had the same features instead of the notch.The price is though lower than its predecessor but it is naturally for the marketting issue.Even the notch is not more stylish in looks than any other smartphones in this range.

"Decent phone at affordable price. Though it's not a huge upgrade compared to note 5 pro but still it's a good bait. Though many youtube reviewers are kinda dissatisfied with this product due to its snapdragon 636 soc( a 2 year old processor) and giving Realme 2 pro an edge over this product due to a more powerful chipset but let's be clear here, color os is a heavy os when compared to miui and hence it requires stronger processor to offer similar performance.
